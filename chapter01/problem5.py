PROBLEM:
    For the following problems, write arithmetic statements based on
    the following problems

PRO TIP:
    Use parentheses! It's your best friend
"""

# EXAMPLE 1
#   Let `a`` be 5, and `b`` be 10. Divide `b` by `a`` and add 76
a = 5
b = 10
example = (10 / 5) + 76

# Let `a` be 7, `b` be 98, and `c` be 555. Get the remainder from
#   the division of `c` to `b`. Afterwards multiply it by 7 and raise it
#   to the power 9
answers[0] =

# Let 'a' be 293, `b` be 22, and `c` be 3.2. Multiply `c` by itself `b`
#   amount of times. Add it to `a` and then divide the resulting number by
#   `c`. Subtract it by `b` to the power of 3.
